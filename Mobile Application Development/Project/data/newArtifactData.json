Before the gladiator became a living legend, he once strolled with his young master in the garden. The master picked a flower and gave it to the silent slave. \"Not all gifts are given out of benevolence. Sometimes they are nothing more than acts of whimsy.\" One day in the far-off future, the gladiator's sly master would say these words to him. The invincible gladiator finally fell at the foreign girl's feet. At that moment he recalled a dream he had had many years ago. \"Such beautiful flowers, I wonder when I'll be able to begin my own journey to see them.\" \"I’d like to see how beautiful the wild flowers are.\"",

And so the Crimson Witch continued to burn, blind to the extent of her devastation.",

Your likeness will forever remain on this wall.” “For the sake of that fresco, and for everyone’s sake, I will pray for you, and wait for your return…” The maiden stood before a blank wall, and smiling, she pinned a small flower to the hero’s breast. That was an elegant and unruffled fellow, who would never bat an eyelid, not even in the face of death itself. The heroism of the Icebreaker was forgotten, buried in the storms of the North. Since then, the snow has melted — but this flower has not withered.",

And when you do touch it, it is as if you can hear cries in the snowstorm, unbowed but bereft of hope. With no nest or shelter, the bird faced the storms proudly. This feather has been assailed with coalescing ice and snow, leaving it coated in pearls of frost. It once came from a falcon in flight and was plucked violently from that bird by the frigid winds. It drifted a while in the air before the weight of the frost dragged it back down to the ground. “I believe that the lively birds will follow you, and return to the gardens of the summer palace, now green once more.” “Those who have been chased away by the chilling tide, and those children who have lost their homes, they will return with you to the home of their dreams.” The hero, bearing such great burdens on his back, halted in the whipping snow, struggling to discern the color of that feather. Sealed in ice, that feather’s color faded every step of the way — just like the hero’s task.",

He was a warrior as silent as the ice itself, blocking the frigid winds that descended from the stars with his body. But not content with merely being protected, the maiden who painted left the man she admired these last instructions: \"If fear or despair, both of which are within our nature, should crush you, or cause you to never return, then...\" \"...Then please, live on. Do not accompany us unto our doom — to languish forgotten in the snow.\" Taking another swig of bitter wine to steel himself for the journey, he turned away from the maiden's wet eyes, And he would set out on an unending pursuit, towards the land of snow and profundity.",

They boost the morale of the citizenry and fill visiting outlanders with a sense of awe.\n\nIt is said that in its inception, this ceremonial custom was inspired by the nameless yaksha.\nIn the heat of battle, when the yaksha was engaged in fierce combat with the Abyss, some of its plumage was stripped away. The feathers that fell to the ground were seen as a symbol of hope.\nIn the end, the brave yaksha and fearless citizenry would sink into an exhausted slumber in the dark lair of the enemy.\nRex Lapis was moved by their sacrifice and observed a prolonged vow of silence among the low murmuring of the mountain stone.\nThe people claim that the nameless yaksha that defended The Chasm was not, in fact, under the command of Rex Lapis.\nInstead, they believe that it was an act of redemption from a longstanding sin... a price paid for cowardice and dereliction of duty.\n\nWhatever the truth of the matter, the yaksha that had once soared through celestial heights had now returned to a free existence amongst the clouds.\nAs for the soldiers, trapped in eternal slumber in the depths of The Chasm... their legend continues to evolve with the flow of time.",

Its bronze surface sparkled in the bright starlight.\nUrban legends tell of a collector of curios wearing black robes, who roamed the market streets one day, buying up Orichalceous Time-Dials and paying a generous sum for each one.\nSome sellers queried him, curious to know what his reasons were, but he deftly deflected all their questions with an array of excuses and other verbal tricks.\nAs for what this individual's true motive was, perhaps only the unyielding forward march of time can finally deliver a satisfying explanation.",

With their gaze fixed ahead of them, they stormed into the abyss.\nHundreds of years later, a conceited adventurer retrieved the cup from the depths of The Chasm and washed away the imperfections.\nMiraculously, the cup remained whole and untarnished by the passage of time. The pitch-dark of that subterranean realm had failed to remove its radiance.\nYet more centuries passed. Eventually, the people of Liyue would tell tales of an era of catastrophe and a nameless yaksha,\nTales of how heroes from disparate heritages and different lands united under a single banner against the Abyss...\nInevitably, the tale would touch upon the cup, and how the blood of those that went before remained clear and spotless as the day it was spilled.",

I'll get your bodyguards ready right now!\"\nHe had no need of guards, of course, but he was lazier still to barter words with cretins.\nDonning his wanderer's hat, he headed eastward alone.\n\n\"Child, where are you going?\"\nReturning home, the youth was stopped at the roadside by an old woman.\nHe told her that he was going west.\n\"To Yashiori Island, then?
